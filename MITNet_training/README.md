# MITNet and BioMITNet Implementation
Part of the project: [Predicting Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)-Associated Epitopes using Deep Learning](https://github.com/itsjustnilay/Epitope_Prediction_DL) <br>

*Project Summary*: Conducted a comparative study on deep learning models (ProtBERT, ReLSO, BEETLE, and MITNet) to predict the immunogenic potential of an epitope for SLE-related outcomes. <br>
*Contribution Statement*: Implement the model architecture of MITNet based on the [original paper](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/24/4/bbad202/7186397). Constructed a new transformer-based architecture, **BioMITNet**, in PyTorch, which integrates epitope sequences and biological features, realizing an F1-score of 0.94 â€“ a 32% improvement over the MITNet model. <br>
